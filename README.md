### Infrastructure Automation Test Framework




Importance of Testing IaC
-------------------------

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) testing is the process of validating and verifying the infrastructure configuration and deployment scripts to ensure they meet the desired state and requirements. Here are some problem description explaing why IaC Testing is important like any other software testing. 

|Problem  |Problem Description|
|:-------------| :-----|
|Configuration Drift | When actual infrastructure configurations deviate from desired states, It may cause inconsistencies and errors |
|Deployment Failures | Untested IaC can result in deployment failures, downtime, and lost productivity due to incorrect or incompatible configurations |
|Compliance Issues   | Non-compliant infrastructure configurations can result in failed audits, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage |
|Resource mismanagement | Unoptimized infrastructure configurations can lead to unnecessary resource utilization, increased costs, and inefficient resource allocation |
|Debugging Issues | identifying and debugging infrastructure issues can become complex and time-consuming |
|Inconsistent Environments | Un-tested IaC can lead to inconsistent environments across QA, PreProd, and Prod causing issues with application behavior and testing |
|Security Vulnerabilities |  Un-tested IaC configurations may expose infrastructure to security risks, such as unpatched vulnerabilities or unauthorized access controls |

# Test Architecture

Below is a list of potential test architecture options. Each architecture dictates its unique testing approach, outlining the stages and methodologies for effective validationAfter careful consideration, I recommend implementing Architecture 3.


|Name  |Architecture Prototype|
|:-------------| :---------------|
| **Architecture 1**  | Continous [Integration - Deployment - Test](https://github.com/Harissh77/IATF/blob/main/documentation/Architecture1.png)   |
| **Architecture 2**  | Continous [Integration - Test - Deployment - Test](https://github.com/Harissh77/IATF/blob/main/documentation/Architecture2.png) |
| **Architecture 3**  | Continous [Integration - Test - AISeflHeal - Deployment - Test](https://github.com/Harissh77/IATF/blob/main/documentation/Architecture3.png) |

# Architecture 3 `(Recommended)`


Continous Integration - Test - AutoFix - Deploy - Test 
------------------------------------------------------

Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into test architecture enhances testing efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. AI-powered testing enables:

1. Intelligent test case generation
2. Automated test data generation
3. Predictive test maintenance
4. Real-time test analytics
5. Self-healing tests

Tools
-----

**Terraform** - Provisioning and managing cloud and on-premises infrastructure

**Tftest** -  Automated tests for Terraform configurations, ensuring infrastructure reliability and validity.

**Jenkins** - For CI/CD pieplines

**Checkov** - Automated security and compliance scanning tool for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configurations

**Pytest** - for Integration Tests.

----------


Test cases will be automated as reusable building blocks, with each test modularized to perform a specific action. This modular design enables tests to be easily combined into tailored test suites for various scenarios, facilitating flexibility and scalability. 
Each test case will be labeled with a specific functional unit tag, enabling precise mapping to system functionality. This architecture empowers users to define and execute test suites using everyday English language, simplifying testing and increasing accessibility. 

### Example of "How any user can build and run the test"

_Build and Test the infrastructure Code on Azure using 'SUSE Linux' from my branch 'HarishFix-1104' with AI 'enabled'_

_Build and Test the infrastructure Code on AWS using 'Red Hat Linux' from my branch 'GauthamFix-1107' without AI 'enabled'_

_Build the infrastructure Code on AWS using 'Ubuntu' from my branch 'HanuFix-1212' and do not 'destroy'_

# Governance & Auditing Test 

Objective : 

To ensure that the organization's IT infrastructure and systems comply with regulatory requirements, industry standards, and internal policies.
By conducting regular governance and auditing tests, organizations can ensure compliance, security, and data integrity, ultimately reducing risk and improving overall IT infrastructure governance.

Scope:
The governance and auditing test will cover the following areas:

1. Compliance with regulatory requirements
2. Adherence to industry standards
3. Enforcement of internal policies and procedures
4. Security controls and access management
5. Data integrity and backup procedures

My solution of choice today is Checkov, Checkov is a governance and auditing tool. It is an open-source tool that enables users to scan and monitor their infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations for security and compliance issues. Checkov seamlessly integrates with Jenkins, enabling automated security and compliance scanning within Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This integration allows for efficient reporting on specific projects, providing timely insights into infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations.

I have developed a demo demonstration showcasing the integration of Checkov with Jenkins Pipeline, highlighting automated security and compliance scanning capabilities for infrastructure-as-code configurations.

# Disaster And Recovery Test 



 
# Demo
|:----:|


A functional prototype has been developed, showcasing the automated provisioning of an AWS instance, execution of tests via TFtest, and resource cleanup. 

Try it yourself !

Steps 

Cmd 1 > git clone https://github.com/Harissh77/IATF.git

Cmd 2 > cd IATF

Cmd 3 > source ./initializer.sh

Cmd 4 > heyIATF

enter the command : Build and Test the infrastructure Code on AWS using 'Red Hat Linux' with AI enabled

Now you can login to http://43.205.230.97:8080/
and see a Job has been triggered , refer Jenkins Pipeline section for User / Password. 

Final Result:
An instance will be created in the AWS with Pre and Post Conditions tests performed on the Infrastructure as Code.
